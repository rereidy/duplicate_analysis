# duplicate_analysis

This Python program is my first real world text analysis effort to support a project I am working on for my employer.

The problem: 

We have a SharePoint site which we use to allow other team members to create data representing opportunities
(existing systems, dashboards, reports, etc.) that could be used within our department to augment compliance testing.  The 
worklist used in the SharePoint site cannot prevent duplicate values entered.

The Python code files perform this text analysis against two dta sources:

1.  The SharePoint data against itself
2.  Another data source from a business partner.
